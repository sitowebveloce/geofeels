Any form of use of the Site by potential clients or subscribing Attorney Users is not intended to and will not create an attorney-client relationship between or among any person, entity, and Pagedone. Any electronic communication sent to anyone at Pagedone other than an Attorney User will not create an attorney-client relationship between the Client User and Pagedone.
